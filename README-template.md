## My process

- Creation Date: 24-06-2025
- Completion Date: 29-06-2025

Current Status: Completed and Deployed

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that using *flex: 1* on a parent container (like .main) when the flex-direction is column can cause child elements to stretch vertically, leading to unintended layout issues. Removing *flex: 1* allowed the child element (.card) to take its natural height based on content.

I realized a common syntax mistake when importing multiple font weights from Google Fonts; the correct separator is a semicolon (**;**) rather than a comma (,) (e.g.,*500;800*)."

### Continued development

I plan to deepen my understanding of Flexbox, particularly ptoperties like *width*, *height* and responsive scaling.Further practice with Figma is also needed.
